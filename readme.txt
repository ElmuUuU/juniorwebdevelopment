Project of Team ThureFabianNick in JuniorWebDev @ XU-University
We decided early on in the project to create a webgame that has several minigames, that has to be played by two players, that are in asymetrical roles. This concept is inspired by
the game Keep talking and nobody explodes. Our unique twist to that game is the time based highscore aspect, that is similar to a website like Human Benchmark. We also came up with
original minigames, that had cool concepts.
One player assumes the role of the coach, who has a webpage with the instructions to the games. He himself does neither play the games himself, nor does he see the player playing them.
The other player sees the screen with the games, but does not know the instructions of the games, and he does not have some clues, that are randomized in the instructions.
For example the player sees a map without labels, and has to find out the name of an indicated location. To do so, he has to communicate with the coach.

We had come up with three games for an initial version, those three games represent the MVP - minimum viable product - in our eyes.
-The first Game was the map game - the player is shown a map without labels and a location that is marked onto it. 



After creating a rough concept we proceeded to set up a gitHub-Repository.
We made the decision to write our project in typescript and use next.js as our frameworks. We chose React as our sub-framework.
Then we made some organisation in folders and sites. Most importantly we created a games folder with the games.
